OpenGL Projects Dump
====================

This repository contains code dumps of two Machine Problems that I worked on in UIUC's CS418 - Interactive Computer graphics. Both projects use OpenGL, the first is a *flight simulator* with various airplane and terrain controls, the second is a demo of *texture and environment* mapping.

Run instructions included in respective directories.
